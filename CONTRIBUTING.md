Hi, if you are reading this is because you pretty likely want to participate in the development of this bot and curious about how to start.

- [ ] Suggest new features.
- [ ] Vote for existing issues (issues with highest number of reactions are likely to be fixed first).
- [ ] Fix `// FIXME: ` comments in the code.
- [ ] Improve the inline documentation.

## What should I know before the start?

**Code guidelines**
We do our best to conform to [the Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with the exception that we use four space tabs instead of two space tabs.

**Commit guidelines**
We follow the semantic versioning approach, this is important so your PR will appear on the Changelog 🎉 ! I guess you expect recognition and we will give it to you.
See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#commit-message-convention-at-a-glance) for commit guidelines.
